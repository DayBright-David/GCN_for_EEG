# GCN_for_EEG
Graph Convolutional Networks for 4-class EEG Classification

# The Full PYTHON interpertation!

### Credits of this work is for :
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [MichaÃ«l Defferrard](https://github.com/mdeff/cnn_graph)| Created the basics of GCN! |
| [Shuyue Jia](https://github.com/SuperBruceJia/EEG-DL) | Created awsome codes for EEG classification|

### What I have done?
Shuyue's work was awsome but preprocessing should be done in MATLAb, which is not available for everyone. So I interperted python version!
I also added other types of GCNs to code  + changed some parts of code




### Results of Preprocessing

1. Absolute Pearso matrix
